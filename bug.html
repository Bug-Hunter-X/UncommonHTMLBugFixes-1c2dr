    This is some text.

  <script>
    // Incorrectly using innerHTML to insert an entire <p> tag
    document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML = "<p>This is a paragraph.</p>";
    //This will cause the paragraph to be treated as text.  This is a subtle error, but can cause problems with styling and accessibility.
